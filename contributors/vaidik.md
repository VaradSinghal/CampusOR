# 👋 Hello Everyone!

I’m **Vaidik Kathal**, and I serve as a **Mentor for the CampusOR project**.

CampusOR is being built as a scalable, real-time queue and reservation system, and my role is to guide contributors in maintaining clean architecture, strong fundamentals, and practical problem-solving approaches throughout the development process.

---

##  Role & Responsibilities

- Mentoring contributors on system design and architecture  
- Reviewing code structure and best practices  
- Guiding feature implementation and scalability decisions  
- Ensuring consistency across frontend, backend, and shared modules  
- Supporting contributors in understanding real-world engineering workflows  

---

##  Vision for CampusOR

The goal of CampusOR is not just to build a functional product, but to:
- Encourage **clean, maintainable code**
- Promote **collaborative open-source learning**
- Apply **real-world engineering principles**
- Build something that can scale beyond a single use case  

I’m excited to work with everyone contributing to this project and help turn CampusOR into a robust, production-ready system.

Happy building 🚀
